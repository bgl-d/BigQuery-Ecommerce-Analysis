# BigQuery-Ecommerce-Analysis

## Data
BigQuery open dataset of a fictitious eCommerce 
clothing site TheLook. The dataset contains information 
about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events 
and digital marketing campaigns. The contents of the dataset are synthetic, and are provided
to industry practitioners for the purpose of product 
discovery, testing, and evaluation.

Because of its artificial nature this dataset have some
limitations or rather simplifications. Most of the items 
were sold only once and its relative revenue contribution 
often equals its sale price.

## Objective

Calculate sales, products, user acquisition channels, 
and customer base metrics.
